# Children Story Generator

This project is focused on fine-tuning and using language models to generate children's stories. It includes various components:

## Project Structure

- `FineTuning/` - Contains notebooks and scripts for fine-tuning language models
  - `HuggingFaceExample/` - Examples using HuggingFace's transformers library
    - `01_finetuning/` - Fine-tuning scripts and notebooks
    - `02_inference/` - Inference notebooks for testing models
- `ml/` - Machine learning models and checkpoints
  - `qwen/` - Qwen model checkpoints and configurations
- `NKI/` - Neural Network Knowledge Integration labs
- `NxD/` - Neural Network Development labs
- `vLLM/` - vLLM integration for efficient inference

## Features

- Fine-tuning of Qwen and TinyLlama models
- Inference examples and benchmarks
- Integration with vLLM for optimized inference
- Various notebook examples for different aspects of model training and usage

## Setup

Please refer to individual notebooks for specific setup instructions and requirements.
